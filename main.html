    <h2>Learn React Native</h2>
    <p>
        React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook.
        It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers
        to use React along with native platform capabilities.
        An incomplete port for Qt also exists.

   <a name="History"> <p><b>History- </b> In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg commented, "The biggest mistake we made as a company was betting
    too much on HTML as opposed to native".He promised that Facebook would soon deliver a better
    mobile experience.Inside Facebook, Jordan Walke found a way to generate UI elements for 
    iOS from a background JavaScript thread.
    They decided to organise an internal Hackathon to perfect this prototype in order to be able
    to build native apps with this technology.After months of development, 
    Facebook released the first version for the React JavaScript Configuration in 2015. 
    During a technical talk,Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production for their Group App and their Ads Manager App.</a>

<a name="example"> <p><b>Example- </b> A Hello, World program in React Native looks like this:
    <br>
    import React from 'react';<br>
    import { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';<br>
  
    const HelloWorldApp = () => <Text>Hello world!</Text>;<br>
    export default HelloWorldApp;<br>

    AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => HelloWorldApp);<br>
    
    import HelloWorldApp from './HelloWorldApp';<br>
</a>
</p>
  
<a name="use"> <p><b>Implementaion- </b> The working principles of React Native are virtually identical 
to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. 
It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) 
directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, 
asynchronous and batched Bridge.React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. 
This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers,
and can let existing native teams work much faster.React Native does not use HTML or CSS. 
Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views.
 React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages
  such as Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift for iOS which make it even more flexible.</a>
